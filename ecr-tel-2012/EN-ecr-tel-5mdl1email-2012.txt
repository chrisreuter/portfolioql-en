Subject: IT trade fair in Paris 

Dear colleagues, 
We are proud to announce that Intersoft is going to present three brand-new, state-of-the-art products at the ‘Salon d’Informatique’ trade show in La Défense near Paris this year. 

The trade show will take place from November 21 until November 23. The Intersoft stand will be in aisle B14. 

As you know, this internationally renowned event attracts more than 20,000 professional visitors every year and orders increased by 20% after last year’s exhibition. 

The Paris staff would be very happy to welcome some of you at our stand this autumn. Please let me know as soon as possible if you wish to attend, and how many days you will stay, so that I can make the necessary arrangements. 

Further information on the exhibition and our new product line can be found on our Intranet. 

Best regards, 
Julien Charbon
