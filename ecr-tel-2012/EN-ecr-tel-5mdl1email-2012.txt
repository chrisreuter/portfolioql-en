Subject: Kick-Off Meeting in Paris

Dear colleagues, 
I'm Sébastien Henocq from the Paris office. I was asked by our management to head the project team you are all members of.

As you know, this project is critical in the launch of a new internal management software that will enable us to cooperate more closely
across borders and that will make all lives so much easier. Your input and commitment is needed to make this a success.

I'm pleased to announce that the kick-off meeting will be held on 15 December in Paris. The meeting will start at 11 am, so that those
of you who want to come to Paris in the morning can do so. The meeting will be finished by 4 pm.

Could you confirm as soon as possible that you can attend. Your participation will be vital, as we are going to lay the foundations
of this important project.

Please feel free to contact me any time for further questions and remarks.

Looking forward to meeting you in Paris.

Best regards, 
Sébastien Henocq
