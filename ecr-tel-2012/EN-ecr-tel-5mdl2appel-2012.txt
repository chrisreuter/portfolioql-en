Phone call
Intersoft UK, switchboard : Good morning, Intersoft. Can I help you? 
Julien Charbon : Good morning, I’d like to speak to Gillian Burton, please. 
Switchboard : Who’s calling, please? 
Julien C.: Julien Charbon from Intersoft France. 
Switchboard : Just a moment, please. I’ll put you through. 
Gillian Burton : Hello? 
Julien C.: Is this Gillian? 
Gillian B.: It is. 
Julien C.: Hi, Gillian. This is Julien Charbon from Paris. 
Gillian B.: Oh, hello, Julien, nice to hear from you again. How are you? 
Julien C.: I’m very well, thank you. And you? 
Gillian B.: Not too bad. How is business in France? 
Julien C.: Oh, you know, things are a little hectic around here since the summer break. 
Gillian B.: Yes, I know. Everything closes down for at least a month in France, doesn’t it? 
Julien C.: Well, more or less. We’ve been quite busy all through the summer to prepare the launch of our new products. But now our clients are back. You know, we get most of our orders in September and October, actually.   
Gillian B.: Really? Well, I’m glad business is going okay. What can I do for you, Julien? 
Julien C.: Well, I’m calling about the trade fair in Paris this year. Did you receive my e-mail? 
Gillian B.: The invitation? Yes, I did. Sorry, I think I haven’t answered yet. In any case, I don’t think I’m going to be able to make it this year, I’m afraid. 
Julien C.: Oh, really. That’s a shame. Actually, I was wondering if you could back me up out here during the exhibition. As you know, the ‘Salon de l’Informatique’ becomes more and more international year after year and I think it would be a real advantage to have you here as a representative of the UK office. 
Gillian B.: I hope you’re not worried about your English? Your English is perfect. 
Julien C.: Thank you. No, it’s not only a language question. You know that on a pan-European basis, the Paris office takes care of sales in the South, namely Spain, Italy, Portugal and so on. But we have more and more visitors from Germany, the Netherlands and Scandinavia, that’s your territory, Gillian! 
Gillian B.: Well, I appreciate that. Look, I would love to come. It’s just that we’re negotiating a huge contract in Scotland at the moment. I think my people need me here right now.   
Julien C.: The trade fair will only take a couple of days. You can keep in touch by telephone and e-mail. We have permanent Internet access on our stand. 
Gillian B.: Maybe you’re right. I’ll tell you what. I’ll see what I can do, maybe change a few appointments. Can I get back to you, say, by the end of the week? 
Julien C.: The sooner, the better. We have little time left to finalise everything. 
Gillian B.: Don’t worry, Julien, we’ll find a way. I’ll give you a call on Friday at the latest. 
Julien C.: Good. That’ll work. Thanks very much for your help, I really appreciate it. 
Gillian B.: No problem. Speak to you soon. And thanks for calling. 
Julien C.: You’re welcome. Bye for now. 
Gillian B.: Bye, Julien.
