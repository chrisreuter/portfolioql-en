Phone call
AVIDIA UK, switchboard: AVIDIA, good morning. How can I help you? 
Sébastien Henocq: Good morning, I’d like to speak to Julian Marx, please. 
Switchboard: Who’s calling, please? 
Sébastien Henocq: Sébastien Henocq from AVIDIA France. 
Switchboard : Just a moment, please. I’ll put you through. 
Julian Marx: Julian speaking. 
Sébastien Henocq: Hello Julian. My name's Sébastien Henocq.
Julian Marx: Yes?
Sébastien Henocq: I'm the manager of the new international project you are a member of. 
Julian Marx: Oh, of course. Sorry, I didn't recognise your name. How are you?
Sébastien Henocq: I'm fine thanks. What about you?
Julian Marx: Very well, thanks. But I'm incredibly busy at the moment.
Sébastien Henocq: Aren't we all? I'm just calling because I haven't heard back from you regarding our meeting in December.
Julian Marx: I'm really sorry, but I just haven't had the time.
Sébastien Henocq: I understand that, don't worry. Can you tell me now if you can come?
Julian Marx: When did you say the meeting was?
Sébastien Henocq: On 15 December in Paris. We'd like to start at 11 am, so if you want to travel in the morning, there shouldn't be a problem. And we will be done by 4 pm.
Julian Marx: Let me just check. Oh, I'm really sorry, but I'm completely tied up that day.
Sébastien Henocq: Oh dear. Well you know how critical the project is for the launch of the new management software. Therefore it's absolutely vital that everyone who's on the project can attend the first meeting.
Julian Marx: Well, I appreciate that. But you see, I'm in Scotland that week to negotiate a very difficult contract there.
Sébastien Henocq: Oh dear. Well you know how critical the project is. That's why I contacted you well in advance. We need to see what everybody's expectations are, so that we can adapt the software accordingly.
Julian Marx: Sure. But if I try to change may appointment with our client, they are not going to like it.
Sébastien Henocq: I understand it's a difficult situation. And we all need to work under pressure. But as I said. it would be essential to have everyone at the table for the first meeting, so that everybody understands what is at stake and can make contributions. After that we can communicate by e-mail or telephone. I think it would also be good for the team to really get to know each other, if we want to work together successfully.
Julian Marx: Yes, of course. And it's only me who can't attend?
Sébastien Henocq: I'm afraid so, Julian.
Julian Marx: Well, I'll see what I can do. Can I get back to you?
Sébastien Henocq: Yes, of course. Could you let me know by the end of the week?
Julian Marx: Yes, I'll do that. And thanks for calling.
Sébastien Henocq: You're welcome. And I really hope you can make it.
Julian Marx: I'll do my best. 
Sébastien Henocq: Ok, I'll let you go then. Looking forward to hearing from you.
Julian Marx: I'll give you a ring as soon as I know. Bye for now.
Sébastien Henocq: Thanks, bye.
