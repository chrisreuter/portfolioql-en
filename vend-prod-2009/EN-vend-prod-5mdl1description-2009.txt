MP3 players allow music lovers to enjoy top-quality recordings anywhere and anytime, whether they are travelling or exercising, commuting or simply relaxing. The new state-of-the-art MP3 player XP3 is, to date, the most powerful tool of its kind on the market, and leads the digital audio revolution. The XP3 enables digital quality recordings, mixings and playbacks of up to 200 hours. You can store music and video from the Internet or CDs directly on the player’s 32 GB built-in memory. The XP3 comes without any moving parts and is operational right from the word go. Another advantage of this, is that the XP3 does not skip or jitter during playback. The XP3 not only plays back musical selections created and mixed on any PC or Mac, but can also record from almost any acoustic source. The old vinyl records, audio tapes, film soundtracks or concert videos, radio programmes can easily be transferred to the XP3 and converted into digital files. 
And finally, the XP3 comes with a top-quality stereo microphone, which enables high quality voice recordings (interviews, speeches, lectures, meetings) but also live music recordings: just store it on the XP3 or burn it onto a CD for external use. Other valuable extras include a powerful rechargeable battery which allows to play back well over 48 hours of music, a remote control, most convenient, and two headphone plug-ins which enable you to enjoy music with your partner whilst travelling. Other accessories can be purchased separately to customize the XP3. In today’s fast-moving world of digital development, the XP3 will certainly remain the ultimate digital audio player for a while - its memory storage can even be expanded with accessory backpacks. And despite XP3’s powerful features and add-ons, it is by far the smallest and lightest MP3 player on the market.
