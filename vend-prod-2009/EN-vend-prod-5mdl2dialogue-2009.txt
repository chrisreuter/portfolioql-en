#### Dialogue
Karim Ben Omar is a sales and marketing student at the IGS group and works at the Interconso trade fair as a trainee. He works for the electronics company PRIOR and, being their representative, promotes their new MP3 player, the XP3. 
Victor Bright walks by and seems interested in the product. 
Karim Ben Omar : May I help you? 
Victor Bright: Is this an MP3 player? 
K.B.O.: It is indeed, sir, you are quite right. It’s the most advanced MP3 player on the market right now. 
V.B.: What do you mean by advanced? 
K.B.O.: State of the art. Unparalleled. Let me tell you a little about it. But may I ask you a question first? 
V.B.: Yes, of course. 
K.B.O.: Are you in the electronics business yourself? 
V.B.: Well, in fact, I run a retail shop for TV and audio supplies in Ireland. I was interested in the new recordable DVD players on your stand. Your colleague over there gave me all the details. I must admit I don’t know very much about MP3 players, but more and more young customers are asking for them. 
K.B.O.: You have probably already heard about the advantages of MP3. It allows you to sample digital recordings from the Internet or from your CDs and mix your own compilations. 
V.B.: But hasn’t it become illegal to download music from the Internet? I was wondering if these things really had a future.  

K.B.O.: You’re right in that the days of piracy and illegal downloading are over, but there are a number of perfectly legal Internet sites, where you can buy and download music files. No, I think MP3s and similar technologies are the future of the music business and soon people won’t have to go to a music store anymore to buy their favourite music. 
V.B.: Okay, and what’s so special about this model? 
K.B.O.: I’d just like to mention two of its many features. First, it’s very easy to handle, even for people who have never used an MP3 player before. The XP3, that’s the name of this little miracle, has its own built-in memory, like the hard disk of a computer, if you like. So you don’t need to handle any moving parts. The device itself is very user-friendly and the user’s manual comes in 10 different languages and is designed for new users of MP3s. Old hands won’t need the user’s manual anyway, because the XP3 is really easy to use. Look, you have a limited number of buttons and very clear symbols and messages on the display, and of course, you can choose the language. 
V.B.: But I need a computer or a CD burner, don’t I? To create MP3 files, no? 
K.B.O.: You would normally create your MP3 files on your PC or Mac, and of course you can still do that with the XP3. But the XP3 also allows you to record music from any other source, your old vinyl records or music cassettes, for example. You can also record your own voice with a microphone, or a live concert or your son or daughter  
 practising the piano. 
V.B.: Oh. Like a Dictaphone? 
K.B.O.: Yes, but the quality of the XP3 is tops and will remain undefeated for quite some time. I could also give you a lot of technical details about its storage capacity and so on. You can store up to 200 hours of music in top digital quality and you can shuffle the tracks directly on your MP3 player. But unfortunately you probably don’t have enough time right now for me to go into too much detail! I’d just like to say that it’s very easy to use and very versatile. 
V.B.: Sounds perfect. But at a price … 
K.B.O.: For all the features the XP3 has, the price of 150 euros is very competitive. 
V.B.: Do you have any written documents on it? 
K.B.O.: Of course. Here you are, sir. That’s our latest brochure with all the details about the XP3 in English. 
V.B.: Thank you very much. 
K.B.O.: And here’s my card. If you give me yours, then I can find the person for you who is in charge of your region in Ireland. Our company has an international network, of course. 
V.B.: That would be very helpful indeed. Here’s my card. 
K.B.O.: Thank you, Mr … Bright. You will hear from us very shortly. 
V.B.: Okay, thank you. Bye. 
K.B.O.: Goodbye, Mr Bright.
