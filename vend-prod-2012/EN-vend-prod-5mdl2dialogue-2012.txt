#### Dialogue
Karim Ben Omar is a sales and marketing 
student at the IGS group and works at 
the Interconso trade fair as a trainee. 
He works for the electronics company 
PRIOR and, being their representative, 
promotes their new tablet, the 
NOMAD 21 4G. 

Victor Bright walks by and seems 
interested in the product. 
Karim Ben Omar : May I help you? 
Victor Bright: Is this A 4G tablet? 
K.B.O.: It is indeed, sir, you are quite right. It’s the one of the most advanced tablets on the market right now. 
V.B.: What do you mean by advanced? 
K.B.O.: It is faster, lighter and more intelligent than many of its competitors. 
Let me tell you a little about it. But may I ask you a question first? 
V.B.: Yes, of course. 
K.B.O.: Are you in the IT business yourself? 
V.B.: Well, in fact, I run a retail shop for 
electronic devices in Ireland. I was interested in the Blu-Ray players on your stand. Your colleague over there gave me all the details. I must admit I don’t know very much about tablets, but we have more and more demand for them. And not everyone can afford an iPad.
K.B.O: Absolutely. Our tablets are fairly priced, but without any compromise on quality.
V.B.: Okay, and what’s so special about this model? 
K.B.O.: I’d just like to mention two of its many features. First, it’s very easy to handle, even for people who have never used a tablet before. All the applications and features are carefully thought through and me personally, I haven't met any difficulties yet.
V.B.: Do you use it yourself?
K.B.O.: Yes, I do. Especially when I'm travelling. This here is my personal device.
Other than its applications, this tablet is incredibly fast, both in terms of its operating system, but also as far as the Internet connection is concerned.
V.B.: It's 4th generation, isn't it? 
K.B.O.: It's 4G compatible, yes. But of course you will need a local operator that provides a 4G network. Here in France, it's only starting now.
V.B.: I think we're a bit more advanced in Ireland. At least in the big cities. But I'm not sure.
K.B.O.: One of the first features that may strike you is the incredibly bright and crystal-clear display. Whether you work in a bright or dark room, outdoors or indoors, you will not have any difficulties. And you have no mirror reflection on the screen.
V.B.: And how large is the screen?
K.B.O.: 10 inches. That's pretty big for a tablet. But it's lighter than many smaller tablets. Just hold it for a second.
V.B.: Yes, it feels good in the hand.
K.B.O.: Now one of the most fascinating extras is the camera. Would you like to take a picture?
V.B.: Ehm, yes. How do I do that? Ah, it's here, I think. Ok, let's take a picture of your stand. ... Oh, quite impressive.
K.B.O.: Can be used for videos as well, of course. But you haven't seen the keyboard attachment. It comes with the tablet, so no extra charge for the customer. And as you can see it is also extremely streamlined.
If you attach it to the tablet, just a second, here we go, then you have a fully operational notebook.
V.B.: OK, I'm convinced. Now how much does this miracle cost?
K.B.O.: Oh, I forgot to mention one very important detail.
V.B.: Here comes the catch!
K.B.O.: No, on the contrary. It's battery life. With 25 hours it is by far the longest on the market right now.
V.B.: OK, and the price?
K.B.O.: How much would you say?
V.B.: Don't know. €450?
K.B.O.: €399. 
V.B.: Oh, that's reasonable. 
K.B.O.: Don't you think? Could I have your details so that I can contact you after the trade fair?
V.B.: Sure. Here's my card.
K.B.O.: Thank you. Here's mine. It was very nice to meet you, Mr. Bright.
V.B.: And you. Thanks for all the information and good luck for the rest of the trade fair.
K.B.O.: Thanks a lot. All the best. Bye.
